Car Prediction Tool
Welcome to the Car Prediction Tool GitHub repository! This repository houses the code and resources for our innovative solution designed to predict car prices accurately. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a machine learning practitioner, or simply curious about automotive analytics, you'll find everything you need to dive into our project right here.

Overview
The Car Prediction Tool utilizes a combination of data analytics, machine learning, and web development technologies to provide users with a seamless experience in predicting car prices. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

Data Analysis: We've used PowerBI to perform in-depth analysis on a dataset comprising over 90,000 rows of data from 8 different manufacturers spanning the years 1974 to 2024. This analysis forms the basis of our predictive model.

Machine Learning Model: We've employed the RandomForestRegressor model to predict car prices accurately. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to ensure reliability and robustness.

Web Application: Our prediction tool is wrapped in a user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit. This allows users to interact with the model effortlessly through a simple and intuitive interface.
